Steady 5vDC output

9-50vDC input (no load)

8-46vDC input (drawing 0.5 - 1.4 Watt load)

	test most current board, with a rpi load
	look at new topologies
	reorganize git	
		5116_05 > bury in new folder
		git folder is rpi_hat
		new folder: 5013-5v
		


new topology: LM5013 - 6-100vin (48v nominal) 3.5A out
	schematic captured, assigning footprints

	called out schottkey diode not available
		new selection: V20PW22HM3_A/I
		added to webench design, and it broke.


***
testing powerhat_rev4.0

test case:
	riden power supply, sweeping DCv, Iout=300mA
	waveforms scope1+ to hat_TP_5v
	observing using waveforms voltmeter
	all equipment gnds connected
	
	Load: 1 small LED + 1kohm R series, tp_5v>gnd

<DC8v: voltage drops to ~1.4v
>DC8.1v: 5.07v, 50mA

sweeping V, in 1v steps:
	as Vin increases, I decreases (expected)
stability drops off at DC46V = 5.06V 32mA

Vout off, adjusted to 50v, vout on
	stable for a few seconds, then drops off
	~1.4V output
tried the same at 48V 52V and 54V
	same result, tho the lower the V the longer it takes to fall apart
	
	
Conclusion: (not quite true)
Rev4 operable with small (<50mA) load
	DC8.1V to 46V 

further testing:
	only sat at each voltage for a few seconds; 
	stress testing at 46V
		by 7minutes, Vout dropped to 3v

	testing again with observation:
		46V held 30mA load @ 5V for 5 minutes
	
	testing at
		24V held 42mA @ 5V at least 12 minutes
			(expecting at least twice as much time)

switching voltmeter to scope 1

ripple present:

8.1v	100mV	>1MHz
9v	139mV	>500kHz
12v	123mV	>500kHz
24v	115mV	200kHz
46v	165mV	150kHz
	 
50v	44mV	600kHz	Vout drops to 1.4V
	fairly abrupt drop, swinging oscillations observed briefly
		then stable
55V	vout drops to 1V

____
pulling LED, adding rpi3 load
		no peripherials

setting riden supply direct to rpi gpio power
	5V 1A
	rpi load spikes to 550mA

attaching powerhat
	
12vin
	vout falls to 3.5v
24vin
	vout falls to 4.8v
36vin
	vout falls to 4v
46vin
	vout falls to 2.7v

scope
24vin 1A	sawtooth wave, 1v peak2peak
		avg 3.5v	
24vin 2A	square with sawtooth lows
		2.5v p2p
		avg 4.2v
		
24vin 3A	avg 4.7v, max 5.2v
		2v p2p
		providing more current gets us closer
			tho riden displays 50mA
			signal not clean enough to truely power rpi
